## Project Title
PHYS08049 Programming and Data Analysis Coursework 

## Description

### Python Programming
- **CP01:** Python program to calculate and print to the terminal the radius and surface area of a sphere from its volume
- **CP02:** Python program to read in the three floating point coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ then calculate and display the roots using the standard formula for roots of quadratic formula, $$r_i=\frac{−b±\sqrt{b−4ac}}{2a}$$
- **CP03:** Python program to explore the behaviour of a damped simple harmonic oscillator for a range of damping coefficients 
- **CP04:** Python program to read in data from a text file in a specified format, perform some simple processing and display the output using pyplot
- **CP05:** Python program to numerically analyse the path of a projectile under gravity and drag force. There are two tasks, one to display the trajectory and the second to display the relation between final kinetic energy and launch angle 

### Data Analysis(LibreOffice)
- **CP02:** Using given measurements, construct the spreadsheet to determine the spring constant of a spring by timing the oscillations of a various masses fixed to the end of it.
- **CP03:** Using given measurements, determine the average decay rate(in counts/sec), and its uncertainty.
- **CP04.1:** Using given measurements, first linearise the equation of a simple harmonic motion with the period $T$, and plot a graph showing the linearised data and the appropriate uncertainties.
- **CP04.2:** Using given measurements, first linearise the equation of a relationship between the resistance $R$ of silicon and temperature $T$, and plot a graph showing the linearised data and the appropriate uncertainties.

- **CP05.1:** Using LINEST,
1. Linearise data from CP04.1, and hence determine a value and uncertainty for $g$.
2. Plot a graph showing the linearised data, the uncertainties and the best-fitting straight line.
3. From a plot of the residuals of the linear fit, comment on the quality of the data, and the appropriateness of the uncertainties.

- **CP05.2:** Using LINEST, 
1. Linearised data from CP04.2, and hence determine the value and uncertainty of $Eg$ in unit $eV$.
2. From the same least-squares fit, determine the value and uncertainty of $R0$ in ohms.
3. Plot a graph showing the linearised data, the uncertainties and the best-fitting straight line.
4. Plot a second graph of the residuals of the linear fit.

- **CP06:** Using LINEST,
1. Determine the experimental values (and uncertainties) of $a$ and $df$ when mashing squares of aluminium foil with sides of length $L$ into spheres of radius $r$.
2. Plot the residuals from your linear fit.
