PHYS08049 Programming and Data Analysis Coursework 

## Description

### Python Programming

- **CP01:** Code calculates the radius and surface area of a sphere based on its volume.

- **CP02:** Given coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$, the code calculates the roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$.

- **CP03:** Code explores the behaviour of a damped simple harmonic oscillator across a range of damping coefficients.

- **CP04:** Code reads a text file, performs some simple calculations, and displays the output using `pyplot`.

- **CP05:** Code numerically analyses the path of a projectile under gravity and drag force. There are two tasks: one to display the trajectory and another to display the relation between final kinetic energy and launch angle.

### Data Analysis(LibreOffice)

- **CP02:** Given measurements, construct the spreadsheet to determine the spring constant of a spring by timing the oscillations of various masses attached to its end.

- **CP03:** Given measurements, determine the average decay rate (counts/sec), and its uncertainty.

- **CP04.1:** Given measurements, linearise the equation of simple harmonic motion with the period $T$, and plot a graph showing the linearised data along with the appropriate uncertainties.

- **CP04.2:** Given measurements, linearise the equation relating the resistance $R$ of silicon to temperature $T$, and plot a graph showing the linearised data  along with the appropriate uncertainties.

- **CP05.1:** Using LINEST,
    1. Linearise data from **CP04.1**, and hence determine a value and uncertainty for $g$.
    2. Plot a graph showing the linearised data, the uncertainties and the best-fitting straight line.
    3. From a plot of the residuals of the linear fit, comment on the quality of the data, and the appropriateness of the uncertainties.

- **CP05.2:** Using LINEST, 
    1. Linearised data from **CP04.2**, and hence determine the value and uncertainty of $Eg$ in unit $eV$.
    2. From the same least-squares fit, determine the value and uncertainty of $R0$ in ohms.
    3. Plot a graph showing the linearised data, the uncertainties and the best-fitting straight line.
    4. Plot a second graph of the residuals of the linear fit.

- **CP06:** Using LINEST,
    1. Determine the experimental values (and uncertainties) of $a$ and $df$ when mashing squares of aluminium foil with sides of length $L$ into spheres of radius $r$.
    2. Plot the residuals from your linear fit.
